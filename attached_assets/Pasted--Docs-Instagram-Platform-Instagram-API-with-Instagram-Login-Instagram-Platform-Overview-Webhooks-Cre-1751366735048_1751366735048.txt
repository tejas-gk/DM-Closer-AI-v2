Instagram API with Instagram Login
The Instagram API with Instagram Login allows Instagram professionals — businesses and creators — to use your app to manage their presence on Instagram. The API can be used to:

Instagram Media Insights are now available for Instagram API with Instagram Login. Learn more.

Comment moderation – Manage and reply to comments on their media
Content publishing – Get and publish their media
Media Insights - Get insights on their media
Mentions – Identify media where they have been @mentioned by other Instagram users
Messaging – Send and receive messages with customers or people interested in their Instagram account
Note: This API setup does not require a Facebook Page to be linked to the Instagram professional account.

To ensure consistency between scope values and permission names, we are introducing new scope values for the Instagram API with Instagram login. The new scope values are:

instagram_business_basic
instagram_business_content_publish
instagram_business_manage_messages
instagram_business_manage_comments
These will replace the existing business_basic, business_content_publish, business_manage_comments and business_manage_messages scope values, respectively.

Please note that the old scope values will be deprecated on January 27, 2025. It is essential to update your code before this date to avoid any disruption in your app's functionality. Failure to do so will result in your app being unable to call the Instagram endpoints.

Limitations
This API setup cannot access ads or tagging.
