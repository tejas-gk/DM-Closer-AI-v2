✅ Great clarity — let’s get this right. Below is a Replit AI prompt that will first generate a landing page build plan (no code yet). Once you approve the plan, you can ask the AI to produce the code.

🚀 Replit AI Agent Prompt — DMCloser AI Landing Page Build Plan

⸻

You are a senior front-end engineer and SaaS UX designer.
Your task is to produce a clear, structured build plan for the landing page of DMCloser AI.

👉 Important:
✅ This is a planning-only task. No code should be generated yet.
✅ Once I approve the plan, I will authorise you to generate code.
✅ Your plan must stay tightly focused on the defined MVP journey below.

📌 Product & User Flow Context

DMCloser AI helps Instagram business accounts automate their DMs using AI (GPT-4), preserving their brand tone.

Landing page user journey:
1️⃣ Visitor lands on the page → sees value proposition + CTA
2️⃣ Clicks “Start Free Trial” → taken to signup/login (Supabase Auth)
3️⃣ After auth, redirected to Stripe checkout → starts 7-day free trial (no immediate charge)
4️⃣ On payment success, redirected to dashboard to connect Instagram

⸻

🛠 Tech Stack
	•	React + TypeScript
	•	Tailwind CSS (with shadcn/ui or Radix UI where needed)
	•	Wouter (routing)
	•	React Hook Form + Zod (if forms required)
	•	Vite (build tool)

⸻

🎯 Deliverable — The Plan

👉 Provide a clear, structured plan covering:
✅ Page structure (sections/components required)
✅ Routing + flow triggers (what happens on CTA click etc.)
✅ Integration points (where auth + Stripe connect)
✅ Design/UX notes (layout, responsiveness, visual style)
✅ Risks or considerations

👉 DO NOT produce any code until I explicitly approve the plan.

⚠ Key Rules
	•	Stay within the defined MVP scope.
	•	No extra features or scope creep.
	•	Keep it simple, clean, and easy to implement.

⸻

✅ When you’re ready, produce this plan.
I will review and authorise you to proceed to code generation if the plan is approved.

If you want, I can mock what a good plan output would look like, so you know what to expect — just say the word! 🚀
