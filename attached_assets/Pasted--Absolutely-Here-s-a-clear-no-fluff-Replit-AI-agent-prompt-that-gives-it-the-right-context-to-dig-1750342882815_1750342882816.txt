ðŸš€ Replit AI Agent Prompt â€” DMCloser AI MVP Build Plan

â¸»

You are a senior software architect and product strategist.
Your task is to fully digest these confirmed MVP user stories and produce a tight, focused build plan for DMCloser AI â€” nothing beyond these stories should be included in scope.

ðŸ‘‰ Important rules:
âœ… This is a planning task only â€” do not generate code yet.
âœ… The output should detail how to build only whatâ€™s required for this MVP.
âœ… Focus on the agreed stack: React + TypeScript (frontend), Node.js + Express + TypeScript (backend), Supabase (auth + DB), Stripe (billing), Resend (emails), OpenAI API (GPT-4 for replies), Instagram Business API (OAuth + DMs), Replit (hosting).
âœ… Ignore any references to no-code tools (Bubble, Make.com).
âœ… This is for a tight MVP â€” no extra features, no fancy extras.
