The Callback URL or Verify Token couldn't be validated. Please verify the provided information or try again later

I have been following the facebook bot setup guide and have setup a callback url that is running on an EC2 instance.

I am getting an error (see title of this) when trying to validate the callback url and verify token.

https://360.finance:1337/webhook is my webhook and the verify token is the same in my environment variable and in my facebook setting.

I set up SSL using LetsEncrypt and from what I can tell, the SSL is not showing as self signed so it looks to be working correctly (please note I'm new to all of this)

Checked at https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=360.finance&hideResults=on and all looks correct.

I have also included the facebook page token as an environment variable and included in my index.js file

I have tested netcat / telnet into that port on my ec2 ip and it is succeeding

For anyone with the same challenge. The fix was to set express.js up as https. The facebook bot article doesn't mention this in the setup. –

I have the same problem. Based on what logged in my server, it even didn't call my url. But when I test my url, it works in browser. –

You must return an http response of the hub.challenge token as a plain text.

The call from verify webhook even not reach my website. My url webhook url works fine in browser. The only think I suspect is I'm using the self-signed certificate. Is this the cause? –

I use let's encrypt and it works fine. It's not supposed to be an issue with self signed certificates. –

in my case it uses hub_challenge (with underscore instead of dot) –

Just to clarify the obvious, hub_challenge is not a string value, but an input parameter available in the incoming request. You return it like return response(request('hub_challenge')); in Laravel for example. –

We need to update the following on Facebook app settings page before adding The Callback URL or Verify Token.

Privacy Policy URL
Category
App Icon (1024*1024)
Its weird that facebook doesn't point our exact error.

Do not use ngrok or localtunnel. I tried both, with no luck.

If you really want your local dev server to authenticate - you can port forward over ssh to your public faced server.

ssh -R 4000:localhost:4000 root@your-server-ip

This way you can setup nginx to reverse proxy 443 to 4000 and handle ssl with certbot

sample config for nginx reverse proxy (before running certbot)

server {
    server_name my-own-domain;
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    index index.html index.htm;
    listen 80;

location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:4000/;
  }
}
So you "only" need:

Your own domain
Your own server
nginx
certbot
SSH Server
And now you have your own private ngrok replacement

If you're using Laravel, you can try github.com/beyondcode/expose. Similar to ngrok, but it works with Meta. –

For python users you need to use a dot not underscore. I don't get it when I use the underscore version Facebook API cant access challenge but when I replicate the same GET request with postman I can access the challenge.

# Wrong way
challenge = request.GET['hub_challenge']

# Right way
challenge = request.GET['hub.challenge']
return HttpResponse(challenge)

After 2-3 hour debugging, my case was returning "\"1412656657\"" instead of "1412656657".

Fixed with returning the value inside Content()

public ContentResult Get()
{
    // validate token
    // get hub.challenge from query string
    var hubChallenge = Request.Query["hub.challenge"];
  
    return Content(hubChallenge, "text/plain");
}

It was already mentioned. But quick question if you are confident that it should work:

IT WILL NOT WORK WITH NGROK.

In my case, I knew that ngrok will not work - so I deployed application to Digital Ocean, and I got default domain from the DO: https://<projectname>.ondigitalocean.app/whatsapp/webhook

I was struggling for 2 hours, until I went to "Webhook" tab (in the left sidebar) and tried to call my webhook.

I got the message: url <url> has been identified as malicious and/or abusive

So I bought the domain and it worked.

This is how it worked for me in FastAPI with Ngrok

@router.get("/whatsapp-webhook")
async def whatsapp_webhook(request: Request,
                           db: AsyncSession = Depends(dependencies.get_db)):
    return int(request.query_params.get("hub.challenge"))```

You need to return a request param back sent by facebook called hub.challenge, code below will show you how to do this in a safeway, if if below is not present so any user can set a webhook in your server, it could lead to bugs as duplicate operations like sending duplicate messages etc.

@GetMapping
public ResponseEntity webhookSignUp(@RequestParam("hub.challenge") String validator, @RequestParam("hub.verify_token") String wppPermanantToken){
    if(wppPermanantToken.equals(tokeYouSet)){
        return ResponseEntity.ok().body(validator);
    }else{
        return ResponseEntity.badRequest().build();
    }
}

The issue seems to be the data type of the returned hub.challenge variable. Make sure you return it as an int or any numerical datatype instead of a string.

Make sure your webhook URL is accessible via GET method for verification, as Facebook/WhatsApp sends a GET request during setup.

To respond during webhook verification, you simply send back the hub.challenge value you received.

Replace 'YOUR_VERIFY_TOKEN' with your actual token.

In your Laravel controller, handle the verification like this:

public function handle(Request $request)
{
    $verifyToken = 'YOUR_VERIFY_TOKEN'; // Set your verify token

    $mode = $request->query('hub_mode');
    $token = $request->query('hub_verify_token');
    $challenge = $request->query('hub_challenge');

    if ($mode === 'subscribe' && $token === $verifyToken) {
        // Respond with the challenge token
        return response($challenge, 200);
    } else {
        return response('Verification failed', 403);
    }
}
WhatsApp Webhook Received Payload

{"hub_mode":"subscribe","hub_challenge":"124607075","hub_verify_token":"some_token_value"}
Note: PHP converts periods (.) to underscores (_) in parameter names.

You can refer to the official Facebook documentation for more details: Facebook Webhooks Verification.
