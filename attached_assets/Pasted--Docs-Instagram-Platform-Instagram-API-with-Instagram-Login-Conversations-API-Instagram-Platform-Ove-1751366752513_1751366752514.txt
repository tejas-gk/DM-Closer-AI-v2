Get Conversations
This document explains how to get information about conversations between your app user and an Instagram user interested in your app user's Instagram media. You can get:

A list of conversations for your app user's Instagram professional account
A list of messages within each conversation
Details about each message including when the message was sent and from who
Requirements
This guide assumes you have read the Instagram Platform Overview and implemented the needed components for using this API, such as a Meta login flow and a webhooks server to receive notifications.

You will need the following:

Access Level
Advanced Access if your app serves Instagram professional accounts you don't own or manage
Standard Access if your app serves Instagram professional accounts you own or manage and have added to your app in the App Dashboard
Access tokens
An Instagram User access token requested from a person who can manage messages on the Instagram professional account
Base URL
All endpoints can be accessed via the graph.instagram.com host.

Endpoints
/<IG_ID>/conversations or /me/conversations
IDs
The ID for the Instagram professional account (<IG_ID>)
The Instagram-scoped ID for the Instagram user in the conversation
Permissions
instagram_business_basic
instagram_business_manage_messages
Limitations
Only the image or video URL for a share will be included in the data returned in a call to the API or in the webhooks notification.

Conversations that are within the Requests folder that have not been active for 30 days will not be returned in API calls.

Get a List of Conversations
To get a list of your app user's conversations for an Instagram professional account, send a GET request to the /<IG_ID>/conversations endpoint.

Sample Request
Formatted for readability
curl -i -X GET "https://graph.instagram.com/v23.0/me/conversations
    ?platform=instagram
    &access_token=<INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
On success, your app will receive a JSON object with a list of IDs for the conversations between you and a person and the most recent time a message was sent.

{
  "data": 
    {
      "id": "<CONVERSATION_ID_1",  
      "updated_time": "<UNIX_TIMESTAMP>"
    },
    {
      "id": "<CONVERSATION_ID_2",   
      "updated_time": "<UNIX_TIMESTAMP>"
    }
    ...
  ]
}

user_id parameter set to the Instagram-scoped ID for the Instagram user in the conversation

On success, your app will receive the ID for the conversation.

{

      },

      {
        "id": "<MESSAGE_1_ID>",      
        "created_time": "<UNIX_TIMESTAMP_MOST_RECENT_MESSAGE>"  
      },
      {
        "id": "<MESSAGE_2_ID>",
        "created_time": "<UNIX_TIMESTAMP>"
      },
      {

      },
...
    ]
  },
  "id": "<CONVERSATION_ID>", 
}
Get information about a message

Default fields are id and created_time.

Note: Queries to the /<CONVERSATION_ID> endpoint will return all message IDs in a conversation. However, you can only get details about the 20 most recent messages in the conversation. If you query a message that is older than the last 20, you will see an error that the message has been deleted.

Sample request
Formatted for readability
curl -i -X GET "https://graph.instagram.com/v23.0/<MESSAGE_ID>
    &fields=id,created_time,from,to,message
    &access_token=<INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
On success, your app will receive a JSON response with a list of fields that you requested and values for each.

  "created_time": "2022-07-12T19:11:07+0000",
  "to": {
    "data": [
      {
        "username": "<IG_ID_USERNAME>",
        "id": "<IG_ID>"
      }
    ]
  },
  "from": {
    "username": "<IGSID_USERNAME>",
    "id": "<IGSID>"
  },
  "message": "Hi Kitty!"
}
