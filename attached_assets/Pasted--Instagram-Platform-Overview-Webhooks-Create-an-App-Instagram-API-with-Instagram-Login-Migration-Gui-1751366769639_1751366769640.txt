Instagram User Profile API
The User Profile API allows your app to get an Instagram user's profile information using the user's Instagram-scoped ID received from an Instagram messaging webhook notification. Your app can use this information to create a personalized messaging experience for Instagram users who are interacting with your app users.

User Consent
User consent is required to access an Instagram user's profile.

User consent is set only when an Instagram user sends a message to your app user, or clicks an icebreaker or persistent menu. If an Instagram user comments on a post or comment but has not sent a message to your app user, and your app tries to send the Instagram user a message, your app will receive an error, User consent is required to access user profile.

Requirements
This guide assumes you have read the Instagram Platform Overview and implemented the needed components for using this API, such as a Meta login flow and a webhooks server to receive notifications.

You will need the following:

Access Level
Advanced Access if your app serves Instagram professional accounts you don't own or manage
Standard Access if your app serves Instagram professional accounts you own or manage and have added to your app in the App Dashboard
Access tokens
An Instagram user access token requested from your app user who received the webhook notification and who can manage messages on the Instagram professional account
Base URL
All endpoints can be accessed via the graph.instagram.com host.

Endpoints
/<IGSID>
IDs
The Instagram-scoped ID (<IGSID>) for the Instagram user interested in your app user; received from a webhook notification
Permissions
instagram_business_basic
instagram_business_manage_messages
Webhook event subscriptions
messages
messaging_optins
messaging_postbacks
messaging_referral
Limitations
If the Instagram user has blocked your app user, your app will not be able to view the Instagram user's information.
Webhook notification
In order to get profile information for an Instagram user who has messaged your app user's Instagram professional account, you need the Instagram-scoped ID for the Instagram user that was sent in a message notification, the value of the messages.sender.id property.

{
  "object": "instagram",
  "entry": [
    {
      "id": "<YOUR_APP_USERS_IG_ID>",  // Your app user's Instagram Professional account ID
      "time": <UNIX_TIMESTAMP>,
      "messaging": [
        {
          "sender": { "id": "<INSTAGRAM_SCOPED_ID>" },    // Instagram-scoped ID for the Instagram user who sent the message
...  
Get profile information
To get an the Instagram user's profile information, send a GET request to the /<INSTAGRAM_SCOPED_ID> endpoint, where <INSTAGRAM_SCOPED_ID> is the Instagram-scoped ID received in a messaging webhook notification, with the fields parameter set to a comma separated list of information you would like to view.

Sample Request
Formatted for readability.
curl -X GET "https://graph.instagram.com/v23.0/<INSTAGRAM_SCOPED_ID> \
  ?fields=name,username,profile_pic,follower_count,is_user_follow_business,is_business_follow_user \
  &access_token=<INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
On success, your app will receive the following JSON response:

{
  "name": "Peter Chang",
  "username": "peter_chang_live",
  "profile_pic": "https://fbcdn-profile-...",
  "follower_count": 1234
  "is_user_follow_business": false,
  "is_business_follow_user": true,
}
