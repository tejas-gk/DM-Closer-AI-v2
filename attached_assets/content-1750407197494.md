## Integrate with any Node.js application

Either you're building a web app with Express, a REST API with Nest.js, a real-time service with Socket.io, a desktop app with Electron, or a command-line tool, Resend seamlessly integrate into your stack.

[Get Started](https://resend.com/signup) [Documentation](https://resend.com/docs/send-with-nodejs)

```

import { Resend } from 'resend';

const resend = new Resend('re_xxxxxxxxx');

(async function() {
  const { data, error } = await resend.emails.send({
    from: 'onboarding@resend.dev',
    to: 'delivered@resend.dev',
    subject: 'Hello World',
    html: '<strong>it works!</strong>'
  });

  if (error) {
    return console.log(error);
  }

  console.log(data);
})();
```

> "I care a lot about easy-to-use libraries and the Resend API design caught my attention. It's the perfect match for Node.js applications (or any JS project)."
