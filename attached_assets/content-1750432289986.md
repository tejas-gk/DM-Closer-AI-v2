# Integrate the customer portal with the API

Learn how to integrate the customer portal using the Stripe API.

With the customer portal, you can provide subscription, billing, and invoicing management to your customers without building it yourself. After you configure and integrate the portal, customers redirect to a co-branded dashboard where they can manage their account based on the functionality you configured.

To integrate your application with the customer portal:

1. [Configure](#configure) the portal’s features and user interface (UI). You can do this in the Dashboard.
1. [Implement a redirect](#redirect) to integrate the portal with your application.
1. [Listen to webhooks](#webhooks) to receive updates to customers’ subscriptions and payment methods.
1. [Go live](#go-live) to use the portal in your production environment.

Or clone one of our sample projects:

* [Firebase](https://github.com/stripe-samples/firebase-subscription-payments)
* [Netlify Identity](https://github.com/stripe-samples/netlify-stripe-subscriptions)
* [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/stripe-samples/developer-office-hours/tree/master/2020-06-29-customer-portal).

You can optionally [customize](#customize) portal sessions to enable different features for different customers.

## Configure the portal

Before you integrate the customer portal, configure its functionality and branding in the Dashboard to define what your users can do with the portal. Its features depend on your product and price catalog, so there are different settings for *sandboxes* and live mode.

If you’re using the customer portal with Stripe Connect, make sure you configure the customer portal for the platform, not a connected account.

If you want to create multiple portal configurations for different sets of customers—or if you’re a *Connect* platform and would like to manage configurations for your connected accounts—you can do that by using the [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/configuration.md):

```dotnet
StripeConfiguration.ApiKey = "<<secret key>>";

var options = new Stripe.BillingPortal.ConfigurationCreateOptions
{
    Features = new Stripe.BillingPortal.ConfigurationFeaturesOptions
    {
        InvoiceHistory = new Stripe.BillingPortal.ConfigurationFeaturesInvoiceHistoryOptions
        {
            Enabled = true,
        },
    },
};
var service = new Stripe.BillingPortal.ConfigurationService();
Stripe.BillingPortal.Configuration configuration = service.Create(options);
```

```go
stripe.Key = "<<secret key>>"

params := &stripe.BillingPortalConfigurationParams{
  Features: &stripe.BillingPortalConfigurationFeaturesParams{
    InvoiceHistory: &stripe.BillingPortalConfigurationFeaturesInvoiceHistoryParams{
      Enabled: stripe.Bool(true),
    },
  },
};
result, err := configuration.New(params);
```

```java
Stripe.apiKey = "<<secret key>>";

ConfigurationCreateParams params =
  ConfigurationCreateParams.builder()
    .setFeatures(
      ConfigurationCreateParams.Features.builder()
        .setInvoiceHistory(
          ConfigurationCreateParams.Features.InvoiceHistory.builder().setEnabled(true).build()
        )
        .build()
    )
    .build();

Configuration configuration = Configuration.create(params);
```

```node
const stripe = require('stripe')('<<secret key>>');

const configuration = await stripe.billingPortal.configurations.create({
  features: {
    invoice_history: {
      enabled: true,
    },
  },
});
```

```python
import stripe
stripe.api_key = "<<secret key>>"

configuration = stripe.billing_portal.Configuration.create(
  features={"invoice_history": {"enabled": True}},
)
```

```php
$stripe = new \Stripe\StripeClient('<<secret key>>');

$configuration = $stripe->billingPortal->configurations->create([\
  'features' => ['invoice_history' => ['enabled' => true]],\
]);
```

```ruby
Stripe.api_key = '<<secret key>>'

configuration = Stripe::BillingPortal::Configuration.create({
  features: {invoice_history: {enabled: true}},
})
```

### Set a product catalog

If you allow customers to upgrade, downgrade, or change the quantities of their subscriptions, you must also set a product catalog. This includes the products and prices that your customers can upgrade or downgrade to, as well as the subscriptions they can update quantities on. See the [guide](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/manage-prices.md#create-product) for more details about creating products and prices. If you’re using the customer portal only for invoicing, you don’t need to set a product catalog.

The portal displays the following attributes of your product catalog:

- **Product name and description**—these attributes are editable in the Dashboard and API.
- **Quantity restrictions per product**—these attributes are editable in the Dashboard.
- **Price amount, currency, and billing interval**—these attributes are immutable and you can only set them when you create them in the Dashboard and API.

### Enable tax ID collection

If you use [Stripe Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax.md) to automatically collect taxes for subscriptions or invoices, you can let customers set and update their tax IDs in the customer portal. Stripe Billing adds the tax IDs to the customers’ *invoices*. To enable this, go to the [Customer portal settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/portal) and toggle on **Tax ID**. For more information, see how customer tax IDs work with [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/tax-ids.md) and [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/taxes/account-tax-ids.md).

Learn how to [set up Stripe Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/set-up.md), [collect taxes for recurring payments](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes/collect-taxes.md), [collect taxes in your custom payment flows](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/custom.md#existing-customer) and [set tax rates for line items and invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/invoicing.md).

### Preview and test

As you configure your settings, you can preview the portal by clicking **Preview**. This launches a read-only version of the portal that lets you see how your customers could manage their subscriptions and billing details.

After saving your settings, you can launch the portal and test it by using a customer in a sandbox. Navigate to a customer in the Dashboard, click **Actions**, and then select **Open customer portal**.

Previewing the portal as a read-only version is only available when your Dashboard is in a sandbox. If you’re unable to preview and test the portal, check your settings to make sure that your configuration is saved in a sandbox. For previewing and testing to work, you also need to have edit permissions in the Dashboard.

## Implement a redirect on your site

A portal session is the entry point into the customer portal. It provides a unique, temporary link to the portal. When a customer wants to manage their billing or invoicing, create a new portal session and redirect them to the session’s `url`.

On your site, add a button that customers can click to enter the portal. Use a POST request to create a portal session:

```html
<form method="POST" action="/create-customer-portal-session">
  <button type="submit">Manage billing</button>
</form>
```

Next, add an endpoint that creates a portal session and redirects your customers. Make sure to authenticate customers on your site before creating sessions for them. To [create a session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions/create.md), you need the customer’s ID and a `return_url`, which is required if a default return URL isn’t set in the Dashboard configuration.

When you create a portal session, Stripe returns the `portal session object`, which contains the session’s [short-lived URL](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/session.md?lang=curl#portal_session_object-url) that your customers use to access the customer portal.

```dotnet
StripeConfiguration.ApiKey = "<<secret key>>";

var options = new Stripe.BillingPortal.SessionCreateOptions
{
    Customer = "{{CUSTOMER_ID}}",
    ReturnUrl = "https://example.com/account",
};
var service = new Stripe.BillingPortal.SessionService();
Stripe.BillingPortal.Session session = service.Create(options);
```

```go
stripe.Key = "<<secret key>>"

params := &stripe.BillingPortalSessionParams{
  Customer: stripe.String("{{CUSTOMER_ID}}"),
  ReturnURL: stripe.String("https://example.com/account"),
};
result, err := session.New(params);
```

```java
Stripe.apiKey = "<<secret key>>";

SessionCreateParams params =
  SessionCreateParams.builder()
    .setCustomer("{{CUSTOMER_ID}}")
    .setReturnUrl("https://example.com/account")
    .build();

Session session = Session.create(params);
```

```node
const stripe = require('stripe')('<<secret key>>');

const session = await stripe.billingPortal.sessions.create({
  customer: '{{CUSTOMER_ID}}',
  return_url: 'https://example.com/account',
});
```

```python
import stripe
stripe.api_key = "<<secret key>>"

session = stripe.billing_portal.Session.create(
  customer="{{CUSTOMER_ID}}",
  return_url="https://example.com/account",
)
```

```php
$stripe = new \Stripe\StripeClient('<<secret key>>');

$session = $stripe->billingPortal->sessions->create([\
  'customer' => '{{CUSTOMER_ID}}',\
  'return_url' => 'https://example.com/account',\
]);
```

```ruby
Stripe.api_key = '<<secret key>>'

session = Stripe::BillingPortal::Session.create({
  customer: '{{CUSTOMER_ID}}',
  return_url: 'https://example.com/account',
})
```

## Listen to webhooks

When subscriptions are upgraded, downgraded, or canceled, you need to make sure that customers receive only the products or services they’re actively subscribed to. Stripe sends notifications of these changes to your integration using *webhooks*. In the `Event` object, look at the ID for the subscription or the customer to determine which customer the event applies to.

Stripe also sends notifications if an invoice is paid to your integration using *webhooks*. In the `Event` object, look at the ID for the invoice or the customer to determine which customer the event applies to.

If you haven’t set up a webhook endpoint with Stripe before, you can use Stripe’s [webhooks documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md) to get started, and then listen for the events described below.

| Event                                                                                                                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| [customer.subscription.updated](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types.md#event_types-customer.subscription.updated)               | Listen to this to monitor subscription upgrades and downgrades. For upgrades, check the `subscription.items.data[0].price` attribute in the subscription object to find the price the customer is subscribed to. Then, grant access to the new product. For downgrades, check the same attribute and adjust or revoke access as needed.

  When a customer uses the portal to upgrade or downgrade a subscription with a [trial](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials.md), the subscription’s trial ends immediately when switching to the new price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| [customer.subscription.deleted](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types.md#event_types-customer.subscription.deleted)               | Listen to this to monitor subscription cancellations. When you receive this event, revoke the customer’s access to the product.
  If you configure the portal to cancel subscriptions at the end of a billing period, listen to the [customer.subscription.updated](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types.md#event_types-customer.subscription.updated) event to be notified of cancellations before they occur. If `cancel_at_period_end` is `true`, the subscription is canceled at the end of its billing period.

  If a customer changes their mind, they can reactivate their subscription prior to the end of the billing period. When they do this, a [customer.subscription.updated](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types.md#event_types-customer.subscription.updated) event is sent. Check that `cancel_at_period_end` is `false` to confirm that they reactivated their subscription. |

## Go live

Make sure to test the portal before enabling it in production. When you’re ready to go live:

When you create a portal session, Stripe returns the `portal session` object, which contains the session’s [short-lived URL](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/session.md?lang=curl#portal_session_object-url) that your customers must use to access the customer portal. You can also create one shareable link for each configuration of the portal with the [login_page](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/configuration.md#portal_configuration_object-login_page) parameter.

- Turn off **View test data** in the Dashboard.
- [Configure](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/portal) the portal in live mode.
- Add your [webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks) in live mode.

Stripe maintains multiple distinct sets of portal configurations: one for live mode and one for each sandbox. To help you validate your integration, making changes in one mode does not affect your configuration in the other.

## Deep link to specific pages

You might want to streamline customer actions and further customize workflows between your own app and Stripe. Customer portal deep links allow you to link directly to a page with the specified action to complete, and to customize the redirect behavior after the customer completes the action. Learn more about using [customer portal deep links](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management/portal-deep-links.md).

## Customize a portal session

You might want to enable a different set of products, prices, or features in the portal for different groups of customers. To use a specific configuration for a portal session, set it as an override when launching the portal. The portal uses the default configuration otherwise.

The Dashboard supports creating and updating the default configuration. You can only manage other configurations using the [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/configuration.md).

```dotnet
StripeConfiguration.ApiKey = "<<secret key>>";

var options = new Stripe.BillingPortal.SessionCreateOptions
{
    Customer = "<<customer>>",
    Configuration = "{{CONFIGURATION_ID}}",
};
var service = new Stripe.BillingPortal.SessionService();
Stripe.BillingPortal.Session session = service.Create(options);
```

```go
stripe.Key = "<<secret key>>"

params := &stripe.BillingPortalSessionParams{
  Customer: stripe.String("<<customer>>"),
  Configuration: stripe.String("{{CONFIGURATION_ID}}"),
};
result, err := session.New(params);
```

```java
Stripe.apiKey = "<<secret key>>";

SessionCreateParams params =
  SessionCreateParams.builder()
    .setCustomer("<<customer>>")
    .setConfiguration("{{CONFIGURATION_ID}}")
    .build();

Session session = Session.create(params);
```

```node
const stripe = require('stripe')('<<secret key>>');

const session = await stripe.billingPortal.sessions.create({
  customer: '<<customer>>',
  configuration: '{{CONFIGURATION_ID}}',
});
```

```python
import stripe
stripe.api_key = "<<secret key>>"

session = stripe.billing_portal.Session.create(
  customer="<<customer>>",
  configuration="{{CONFIGURATION_ID}}",
)
```

```php
$stripe = new \Stripe\StripeClient('<<secret key>>');

$session = $stripe->billingPortal->sessions->create([\
  'customer' => '<<customer>>',\
  'configuration' => '{{CONFIGURATION_ID}}',\
]);
```

```ruby
Stripe.api_key = '<<secret key>>'

session = Stripe::BillingPortal::Session.create({
  customer: '<<customer>>',
  configuration: '{{CONFIGURATION_ID}}',
})
```

If you’re a Connect platform, you can specify `on_behalf_of` when launching the portal. This causes the branding, logo, and business name of the portal session to reflect the `on_behalf_of` account. In addition, the portal only shows subscriptions and invoices with the `on_behalf_of` account specified. To learn more about `on_behalf_of`, see the [on_behalf_of documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers.md#settlement-merchant).

```dotnet
StripeConfiguration.ApiKey = "<<secret key>>";

var options = new Stripe.BillingPortal.SessionCreateOptions
{
    Customer = "<<customer>>",
    Configuration = "{{CONFIGURATION_ID}}",
    OnBehalfOf = "{{CONNECTED_ACOUNT_ID}}",
};
var service = new Stripe.BillingPortal.SessionService();
Stripe.BillingPortal.Session session = service.Create(options);
```

```go
stripe.Key = "<<secret key>>"

params := &stripe.BillingPortalSessionParams{
  Customer: stripe.String("<<customer>>"),
  Configuration: stripe.String("{{CONFIGURATION_ID}}"),
  OnBehalfOf: stripe.String("{{CONNECTED_ACOUNT_ID}}"),
};
result, err := session.New(params);
```

```java
Stripe.apiKey = "<<secret key>>";

SessionCreateParams params =
  SessionCreateParams.builder()
    .setCustomer("<<customer>>")
    .setConfiguration("{{CONFIGURATION_ID}}")
    .setOnBehalfOf("{{CONNECTED_ACOUNT_ID}}")
    .build();

Session session = Session.create(params);
```

```node
const stripe = require('stripe')('<<secret key>>');

const session = await stripe.billingPortal.sessions.create({
  customer: '<<customer>>',
  configuration: '{{CONFIGURATION_ID}}',
  on_behalf_of: '{{CONNECTED_ACOUNT_ID}}',
});
```

```python
import stripe
stripe.api_key = "<<secret key>>"

session = stripe.billing_portal.Session.create(
  customer="<<customer>>",
  configuration="{{CONFIGURATION_ID}}",
  on_behalf_of="{{CONNECTED_ACOUNT_ID}}",
)
```

```php
$stripe = new \Stripe\StripeClient('<<secret key>>');

$session = $stripe->billingPortal->sessions->create([\
  'customer' => '<<customer>>',\
  'configuration' => '{{CONFIGURATION_ID}}',\
  'on_behalf_of' => '{{CONNECTED_ACOUNT_ID}}',\
]);
```

```ruby
Stripe.api_key = '<<secret key>>'

session = Stripe::BillingPortal::Session.create({
  customer: '<<customer>>',
  configuration: '{{CONFIGURATION_ID}}',
  on_behalf_of: '{{CONNECTED_ACOUNT_ID}}',
})
```

## Customize branding

To customize the portal:

1. Go to the [Branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding) page, upload your icon or logo, and customize colors.
1. Go to the [Public account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public) page and review your public business name and information.
