# Activate the no-code customer portal

Set up Stripe's customer portal with a no-code configuration.

Activate a link that you add to your website or share with your customers, allowing them to self-manage their payment details, invoices, and subscriptions.

You can set up the customer portal in a few minutes, without writing any code.

See how your customers can log in with the portal login link

## Set up the customer portal

1. **Activate a customer portal link**
   On the [customer portal configuration](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/portal) page, click **Activate link** in the **Ways to get started** section.

1. **Configure the portal**
   Go to the [customer portal configuration](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/portal) page and select your configuration options. Learn more about [configuration options](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management/configure-portal.md).

1. **Share the portal login link**
   Add the link you activated to your site, or send it directly to your customers. They can log in to the portal with their email address and a one-time passcode.

   Make sure your customers have an [email](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object.md#customer_object-email) set. If multiple customers have the same email address, Stripe selects the most recently created customer that has both that email and an active subscription.

   For security purposes:

   - Customers can’t update their email address through this link.
   - If a customer doesn’t receive a one-time passcode after clicking the login link, make sure their email address matches the email address of an existing customer. To check, enter the email address in the search bar of your [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/).

## Customize branding

To customize the portal:

1. Go to the [Branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding) page, upload your icon or logo, and customize colors.
1. Go to the [Public account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public) page and review your public business name and information.

## Prefill customer email

You can use a `prefilled_email` URL parameter in the query string of your login link URL to streamline the login process.

Example login link: `https://billing.stripe.com/p/login/test_4gw6oJchs69w47e7ss?prefilled_email=jenny%40example.com`

| Parameter         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                         | Syntax                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| `prefilled_email` | Use `prefilled_email` to enter an email address on the login page automatically. This can be useful when sending the login link to your customers directly.

  Customers can still edit this field. | `prefilled_email` must be a valid email address. Invalid values are silently dropped and your login link will continue to work as expected.

  We recommend [encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) email addresses that you attach as URL parameters to reduce the risk of not passing them through to your login link. |
