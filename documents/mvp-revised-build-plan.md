## Lean SaaS Dashboard Architecture

### Core Dashboard Sections
1. **Overview/Home** - Key metrics, recent activity, quick actions
2. **Conversations** - Main DM management interface with AI responses
3. **AI Settings** - Tone configuration and response preferences
4. **Analytics** - Usage tracking, quotas, and performance metrics
5. **Settings** - Profile, notifications, billing, account management

### Navigation Structure
```
Dashboard Layout:
├── Sidebar Navigation
│   ├── Overview (Dashboard home)
│   ├── Conversations (Main feature)
│   ├── AI Settings (Tone configuration)
│   ├── Analytics (Usage & metrics)
│   └── Settings (Profile & preferences)
├── Header Bar
│   ├── User profile dropdown
│   ├── Notifications bell
│   ├── Usage quota indicator
│   └── Help/support access
└── Main Content Area
    └── Dynamic content based on selected section
```

### Database Schema Updates (Minimal)

```sql
-- Keep existing conversation and message tables
-- Add minimal extensions for dashboard functionality

-- AI response tracking
ALTER TABLE messages ADD COLUMN ai_generated BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
ALTER TABLE messages ADD COLUMN tone_used VARCHAR(50);
ALTER TABLE messages ADD COLUMN response_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending';

-- Usage tracking (simplified)
CREATE TABLE user_usage (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  month DATE NOT NULL,
  ai_responses_used INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  quota_limit INTEGER DEFAULT 100,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- User preferences (consolidated)
CREATE TABLE user_preferences (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  ai_tone VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'friendly',
  custom_instructions TEXT,
  notification_preferences JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
