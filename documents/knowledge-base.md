## Plan Reviews

### Instagram DM Integration Plan Review
**Reviewer:** Critical Peer Review  
**Review Date:** June 19, 2025  
**Plan Version:** 1.0  
**Review Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è MODERATE CONFIDENCE - Multiple Critical Gaps Identified

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Logic and Coverage Gaps

**Authentication Flow Oversimplified**
- Plan assumes simple OAuth connection but Instagram Business API requires complex App Review process
- Missing consideration for Instagram account verification requirements (business account, follower count minimums)
- No mention of webhook verification token implementation for security
- OAuth redirect URI configuration not addressed in technical requirements

**Database Schema Insufficient**
- Proposed schema additions don't account for Instagram conversation metadata (thread types, participant info)
- Missing fields for Instagram message status tracking (delivered, read, failed)
- No consideration for Instagram's conversation folder system (Primary/Requests/General)
- Platform field as simple TEXT may not scale for future platform additions

**Rate Limiting Underestimated**
- 200 calls/hour limit is per-user but plan doesn't specify how this maps to application usage patterns
- No batching strategy for multiple conversations per user
- Missing rate limit monitoring and user notification system
- Queue implementation mentioned but not architected

**Message Format Conversion Missing Detail**
- Instagram messages have complex attachment and reaction structures not addressed
- Text-only assumption may not hold even for MVP (users expect emoji, mentions)
- No handling of Instagram message types (shares, reactions, story replies)

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Over-Engineering and Unnecessary Complexity

**Single Service File Approach May Be Insufficient**
- `server/lib/instagram.ts` expected to handle OAuth, webhooks, API calls, and format conversion
- This violates single responsibility principle and will become maintenance burden
- Recommend separate modules for auth, webhooks, and API client

**Universal AI Settings Assumption**
- Plan assumes Instagram conversations work identically to internal conversations for AI
- Instagram has unique context (public profiles, business hours, customer service expectations)
- May need platform-specific prompt adjustments even with universal tone settings

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Critical Assumptions Requiring Validation

**Instagram Business Account Requirements**
- **ASSUMPTION:** User has Instagram Business account
- **VALIDATION NEEDED:** What happens for Creator accounts? Personal accounts?
- **RISK:** Significant user base may not qualify for Business API access

**24-Hour Response Window Handling**
- **ASSUMPTION:** Simple detection and routing sufficient
- **VALIDATION NEEDED:** How to handle edge cases (timezone differences, delayed webhooks)?
- **RISK:** Message failures could damage customer relationships

**Existing System Integration**
- **ASSUMPTION:** Current conversation schema and UI can seamlessly accommodate Instagram
- **VALIDATION NEEDED:** Review actual message threading and UI components for compatibility
- **RISK:** May require more extensive frontend changes than anticipated

**Instagram API Sandbox Access**
- **ASSUMPTION:** Development and testing can be completed with Instagram's developer tools
- **VALIDATION NEEDED:** Confirm sandbox environment availability and limitations
- **RISK:** May require production Instagram account for proper testing

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Missing Risk Assessment Areas

**Instagram Policy Compliance**
- No mention of Instagram Platform Policy requirements
- Missing automated message disclosure requirements (especially for AI responses)
- No consideration of message content moderation requirements

**Data Privacy and GDPR**
- Instagram user data processing not addressed in plan
- Missing data retention and deletion policies for Instagram conversations
- No mention of user consent mechanisms for data processing

**Webhook Reliability**
- Single webhook endpoint presents single point of failure
- No retry mechanism for failed webhook processing
- Missing webhook signature verification implementation details

**Token Management Security**
- Instagram access tokens stored in user_preferences table without encryption details
- No token rotation strategy mentioned
- Missing handling of revoked or expired tokens

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Timeline Realism Assessment

**7-Day Timeline Appears Aggressive**
- Instagram App Review process alone can take 1-2 weeks
- No buffer time for Instagram API integration debugging
- Testing phase (continuous throughout) insufficient for production-quality integration
- Database migration and existing system regression testing not accounted for

**Recommended Timeline Adjustment:**
- Phase 0: Instagram App Setup and Review (5-10 days)
- Phase 1: OAuth and Webhook Foundation (5 days)
- Phase 2: Message Processing Integration (3-4 days)
- Phase 3: Testing and Production Polish (3-4 days)
- **Total Realistic Timeline:** 16-21 days

#### Summary and Recommendations

**Confidence Level:** üü° MODERATE CONFIDENCE (60%)

**Primary Concerns:**
1. Instagram Business API complexity underestimated
2. Database schema may require significant expansion
3. Timeline too aggressive for production-quality integration
4. Missing critical compliance and security considerations

**Recommended Actions Before Implementation:**
1. **Validate Instagram App Review requirements** - Confirm eligibility and timeline
2. **Expand database schema design** - Account for Instagram-specific metadata
3. **Design comprehensive webhook verification** - Security-first approach
4. **Create realistic testing strategy** - Include Instagram sandbox limitations
5. **Revise timeline** - Add buffer for Instagram API complexities

**Alternative Recommendation:**
Consider implementing Instagram integration as proof-of-concept first, with limited user base, before full production rollout. This reduces risk while validating assumptions.

- Multi-tab session sync test
- Logout process
- Session cleanup verification

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Login form accepts valid credentials
- Dashboard loads immediately after login
- Session persists through page refresh
- Multiple tabs show consistent auth state
- Logout clears all session data
- Redirect to login after logout

**3. Password Reset Journey**

**Test Flow:** Forgot password to successful login
- Access "Forgot Password" link
- Enter registered email address
- Confirm reset email sent message
- Follow reset link (simulated)
- Enter new password
- Confirm password change
- Login with new credentials
- Access authenticated areas

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Reset form accepts valid email
- Confirmation message appears
- Reset link validates properly
- New password meets requirements
- Login succeeds with new password
- Full access restored to account

**4. Direct Authentication Only**

**Note:** OAuth authentication (Google) has been removed. Users can only authenticate using email/password.

#### Test Data and Environment Setup

**1. Test User Accounts**
```typescript
const testUsers = {
  validUser: {
    email: 'test.user@example.com',
    password: 'TestPass123!',
    firstName: 'Test',
    lastName: 'User'
  },
  adminUser: {
    email: 'admin@example.com',
    password: 'AdminPass123!',
    firstName: 'Admin',
    lastName: 'User'
  },
  oauthUser: {
    email: 'oauth.user@gmail.com',
    provider: 'google',
    firstName: 'OAuth',
    lastName: 'User'
  }
}
```

**2. Database Test Environment**
- Isolated test database separate from development
- Automated test data seeding and cleanup
- Profile table with test user data
- Supabase auth table synchronization

**3. Mock Configurations**
```typescript
// Email service mocking
const mockEmailService = {
  sendConfirmation: jest.fn(),
  sendPasswordReset: jest.fn(),
  sendWelcome: jest.fn()
}

// OAuth provider mocking
const mockOAuthProvider = {
  google: {
    simulate: jest.fn(),
    returnValidUser: jest.fn(),
    returnError: jest.fn()
  }
}
```

**4. Environment Variables for Testing**
```bash
# Test Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://test-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=test_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=test_service_key

# Test OAuth Configuration
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=test_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=test_google_client_secret
```

#### Assumptions and Clarifications Required

**1. Email Confirmation Requirements**
- **Assumption:** Email confirmation is required for new accounts
- **Clarification Needed:** Should test environment bypass email confirmation?
- **Testing Impact:** Need mock email service or confirmation bypass

**2. OAuth Provider Configuration**
- **Assumption:** Google OAuth is fully configured in Supabase
- **Clarification Needed:** Are there other OAuth providers to test?
- **Testing Impact:** Mock configuration for each supported provider

**3. Profile Data Requirements**
- **Assumption:** First name and last name are required fields
- **Clarification Needed:** What other profile fields are mandatory?
- **Testing Impact:** Test data structure and validation rules

**4. Session Management Policies**
- **Assumption:** Sessions expire after Supabase default timeout
- **Clarification Needed:** Are there custom session duration requirements?
- **Testing Impact:** Session timeout testing scenarios

**5. Security and Compliance Requirements**
- **Assumption:** Standard Supabase security practices are sufficient
- **Clarification Needed:** Are there additional security requirements (2FA, etc.)?
- **Testing Impact:** Additional security feature testing

**6. Error Handling Expectations**
- **Assumption:** User-friendly error messages are required
- **Clarification Needed:** What level of technical detail in error messages?
- **Testing Impact:** Error message validation and user experience testing

#### Implementation Notes

**1. Test Framework Setup**
- Use Vitest for unit and integration tests
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Playwright for E2E testing
- MSW for API mocking

**2. Test Coverage Targets**
- Unit tests: 90% coverage for auth services
- Integration tests: 85% coverage for auth flows
- E2E tests: 100% coverage for critical user journeys

**3. Continuous Integration**
- All tests run on pull request
- E2E tests run on staging deployment
- Performance regression testing for auth operations

**4. Test Maintenance**
- Regular test data refresh
- Mock service updates with Supabase changes
- Test documentation updates with feature changes
