# Stripe 7-Day Free Trial Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides a programmatic 7-day free trial system using Stripe's `trial_period_days` parameter. When users subscribe to any plan, they automatically receive a 7-day trial period before billing begins.

## Implementation Approach

**Option A: Using `trial_period_days`**
- Simple and reliable approach using Stripe's built-in trial functionality
- Automatically handles trial period calculations and billing cycles
- Supports all subscription types and pricing models
- Minimal code complexity with maximum reliability

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Trial Creation
- All new subscriptions automatically include a 7-day trial period
- No payment required during trial (card details collected for future billing)
- Trial period starts immediately upon subscription creation

### 2. Trial Status Tracking
- Real-time trial status via API endpoint `/api/trial-status`
- Days remaining calculation
- Trial end date tracking
- Subscription status monitoring

### 3. Email Notifications
- Trial ending reminder (2 days before expiration)
- Payment failure notifications
- Welcome emails with trial information

### 4. Webhook Event Handling
- `customer.subscription.trial_will_end` - Trial ending soon
- `invoice.payment_failed` - Payment issues after trial
- `customer.subscription.updated` - Status changes
- `customer.subscription.created` - New trials

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified/Created

1. **server/lib/stripe/checkout.ts** - Modified checkout session creation
2. **server/lib/stripe/webhooks.ts** - New webhook handlers
3. **server/lib/stripe/trials.ts** - Trial management utilities
4. **server/lib/resend/emails.ts** - Email notification system
5. **server/routes.ts** - API endpoints and webhook handler

### API Endpoints

#### GET /api/trial-status
Returns trial information for a user:
```json
{
  "isInTrial": true,
  "trialEnd": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "daysRemaining": 5,
  "subscriptionId": "sub_1234567890",

}
```

const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  mode: 'subscription',
  customer: customerId,

  }],
  subscription_data: {
    trial_period_days: 7,
    trial_settings: {
      end_behavior: {
        missing_payment_method: 'cancel'
